üöÄ Usage Guide
Follow these steps to preprocess the data, train models, and visualize results:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Preprocess the Data
Clean datasets, handle missing values, and prepare your data for modeling:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/data_preprocessing_script.py \
  --input datasets/data-temperature-depth-missing.xlsx \
  --output datasets/processed-data.xlsx
Input: datasets/data-temperature-depth-missing.xlsx
Output: datasets/processed-data.xlsx
2Ô∏è‚É£ Train Machine Learning Models
Train the provided models using the datasets:

üîπ Gaussian Process (GP)
bash
Copy code
python models/gp_model_training.py \
  --dataset datasets/GP-result-no-outlier.xlsx \
  --output models/gp_results/
üîπ Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
bash
Copy code
python models/mlp_training.py \
  --train datasets/dataset-1.arff \
  --test datasets/dataset-2.arff \
  --output results/mlp_results/
üîπ Random Forest (RF)
bash
Copy code
python models/rf_training.py \
  --train datasets/dataset-1.arff \
