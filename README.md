To format your code blocks in a GitHub README to appear as they do in the example, follow these steps:

Markdown Syntax for GitHub Code Preview
Use Triple Backticks (```):

Wrap your code with triple backticks (```) to create a code block.
Specify the language for syntax highlighting (e.g., python, bash, etc.).
Add Comments and Indentation:

Include comments (# or //) and organize the code with proper indentation to enhance readability.
Example for Your README.md
Here‚Äôs how you can structure it for GitHub:

## üöÄ Usage Guide

Follow these simple steps to preprocess the data, train models, and visualize results:

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Preprocess the Data
Clean datasets, handle missing values, and prepare your data for modeling:
```bash
python scripts/data_preprocessing_script.py \
  --input datasets/data-temperature-depth-missing.xlsx \
  --output datasets/processed-data.xlsx

Input: datasets/data-temperature-depth-missing.xlsx
Output: datasets/processed-data.xlsx
---
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Train Machine Learning Models
Use the provided datasets to train models and generate predictions:

üîπ Gaussian Process (GP)
---
bash
Copy code
python models/gp_model_training.py \
  --dataset datasets/GP-result-no-outlier.xlsx \
  --output models/gp_results/
---
üîπ Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
bash
Copy code
python models/mlp_training.py \
  --train datasets/dataset-1.arff \
  --test datasets/dataset-2.arff \
  --output results/mlp_results/

üîπ Random Forest (RF)
bash
Copy code
python models/rf_training.py \
  --train datasets/dataset-1.arff \
  --test datasets/dataset-2.arff \
  --output results/rf_results/

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Visualizations
Create cross-plots and other visualizations for your results:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/plot_generator.py \
  --input results/mlp_results/predicted_vs_measured.xlsx \
  --output plots/mlp_crossplot.png

Input: Model predictions (e.g., predicted_vs_measured.xlsx)
Output: Plot saved in plots/mlp_crossplot.png

System Requirements
Python: 3.8+
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
yaml
Copy code


### Tips for Enhancing Code Blocks in GitHub:

1. **Add Syntax Highlighting**:
   - Use the language name after the opening backticks, e.g., ` ```python ` for Python code, ` ```bash ` for terminal commands.

2. **Ensure Proper Indentation**:
   - Indent code appropriately to make it visually pleasing.

3. **Use Comments**:
   - Add inline comments in your code to explain each step (e.g., `# Input data file`).

4. **Avoid Long Lines**:
   - Break long lines using backslashes (`\`) for better readability.
